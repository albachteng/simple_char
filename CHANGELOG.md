### Changed
- Updated CLAUDE.md with testing documentation and planned features

- **Stat overrides to additive modifiers** - Changed from absolute value replacement to bonus/penalty system with 0-30 clamping
- **Equipment slots reworked** - Added main-hand/off-hand weapon distinction with visual indicators
- **Combat mechanics enhanced** - Off-hand attacks get no level bonus, off-hand damage gets no stat modifier
- **AC calculation improved** - Now includes equipment stat bonuses and enchantment bonuses
- **CharacterDisplay refactored** - Replaced manual h3 tags with standardized CompactResourceDisplay component (2025-07-08 11:56:40 CDT)
- **Style consistency improved** - Updated CharacterDisplay, AbilityViewer, LogViewer, and NotesManager to use theme constants instead of hardcoded colors (2025-07-08 13:26:23 CDT)

### Fixed
- Corrected maneuvers calculation for STR stat: now returns character level when STR >= 16, instead of level modifier
- Fixed inconsistency between `maneuvers` method and `combat_maneuvers` in useChar hook (both now use >= 16)
- **Fixed Mantine Grid import** - Using `Grid.Col` instead of separate `Col` import
- **Removed polearm weapon type** - Cleaned up from types and constants
- **LogViewer display issues** - Auto-refresh now properly shows logs, improved styling with smaller icons
- **CRITICAL: Fixed massive chevron icons** - Resolved 746x749px Select dropdown arrows caused by global flexbox CSS interference
- **Fixed chevron positioning** - Removed problematic global flexbox layout, simplified to grid-based approach for better component control
- **MAJOR: Replaced Mantine Select with custom component** - Built reliable CustomSelect from scratch to eliminate layout issues entirely
- **Improved contrast and readability** - Updated CustomSelect and log colors for dark theme compatibility with high-contrast text
- **Fixed inventory state management** - Resolved equipment conflicts and character reset issues
- **Fixed stat override state persistence** - Override states now properly activate on load and respond immediately to toggle
- **Fixed NumberInput layout issues** - Custom component eliminates Mantine layout problems
- **CRITICAL: Fixed sorcery and finesse point calculation bug** - Resource points now correctly scale with level instead of being capped at base values (2025-07-08 13:36:57 CDT)
- **CRITICAL: Implemented non-retroactive resource system** - Sorcery and finesse points are now only granted for levels gained AFTER reaching required stat thresholds, encouraging strategic stat investment timing. Combat maneuvers remain immediate/retroactive. Added comprehensive threshold tracking to save/load system to ensure proper resource progression across character sessions. (2025-07-08 13:52:00 CDT)
